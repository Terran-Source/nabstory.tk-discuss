# Let's discuss anything in https://www.nabstory.tk

We created https://www.nabstory.tk out of passion, pure fun & love for humanity. Being there, living with it, **WE** still can't represent the whole human race. Everyone has their own right to express what they want to (with taking proper care not to cause a permanent harm to anyone else). Initially the whole website & the technology was created with openness in mind, but sadly, we felt we're all not ready for it, yet. Hence, with deep regret, we have to shut the door for now.

This repository is an **_attempt_** and/or a **_social experiment_** to **at least** keep the window open. Any suggestions or problem or comments about any posts in https://www.nabstory.tk!!! Let's discuss here.
